# Tutorial Transcripts

## Abstract

This is a repository of various transcripts of video tutorials.
The first one was hosted by Dr. William E. Byrd (webyrd.net)

[YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GfFlfToBCo&t=10s)


Note: This transcript was started by Dr. Byrd. I attempted to add some stuff to it.
My additions are pretty rough and mostly not in pretty printed format with respect to  proper
Scheme formatting. Also, the time codes  for my additions are not yet done.

The code that I wrote has been tested in Racket, but was originally tested in
Chez Scheme for Dr. Byrd's original content.
