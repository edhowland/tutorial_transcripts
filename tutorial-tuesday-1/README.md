Note: This transcript was started by Dr. Byrd. I attempted to add some stuff to it.
My additions are pretty rough and mostly not in pretty printed format wrt proper
Scheme formatting. Also, the timecodes  for my additions are not yet done.

The code that I wrote has been tested in Racket, but was originally tested in
Chez Scheme for Dr. Byrd's original content.
